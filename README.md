# Object-Detection-and-Classification-using-OpenVINO

This Object detection and Classification application can be used to detect and classify the objects of the drone (UAV) image or video streams using Intel® OpenVINOOpenVINO™ toolkit.
This application is been developed as a part of project showcase challenge.

## Models

We used [person-vehicle-bike-detection-crossroad-1016](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_person_vehicle_bike_detection_crossroad_1016_description_person_vehicle_bike_detection_crossroad_1016.html) to detect and classify the objects in a frame streamed by drone (UAV).

## Requirements

### Software

*  [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/choose-download?)
*  OR Udacity classroom workspace for the related course

## Setup

### Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit

For your convenience, you can utilize the classroom workspace, or refer to the relevant instructions for your operating system for this step.

- [Linux/Ubuntu](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux.html)
- [Mac](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_macos.html)
- [Windows](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_windows.html)

## Run the Program 

### Command Line Arguments

 - `-i`  : The location of the input file or "CAM" for the camera streaming
 - `-d`  : The device name, if not "CPU"
 - `-ct` : The confidence threshold to use with the bounding boxes for face detection, default value is 0.5
 
### Command to run the program
 Example for input image or video 
 
 ```python app.py -i input/image/or/video/path -ct 0.4```
 
 Example for camera streaming
 
 ```python app.py -i CAM -ct 0.4```
 
## Future Works 
 - implement the Server Communications for this application
 - Detect more objects through this application
 - This application can be extended to identify the different objects in nature
 - Can be used in Traffic signal control through vehicles and pedestrians detection
 - Tuning the application can also be used for intruders detection in boarders
 - Aerial Mapping, 3D Modelling and Photogrammetry 
 - Applying this model to capture 3D Land Terrain Models and Visualisation for flood monitoring
 - Applying this model to construction site investigation and boarder security 
 - Using the UAV data acquisition and photogrammetry to enhance sustainability in Oil and Gas data exploration
